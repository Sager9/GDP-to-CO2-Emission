Something we wanted to look into was the effect that renewable energy consumption had on a states GDP to CO2 Emissions level

There were a few things that came to mind when we were predicting the outcomes at the start of this project. When I think about renewable energy, I think about solar or wind power, which emit little to no greenhouse gasses, but in terms of an energy source such as fossil fuels, the CO2 emissions skyrocket in comparison. So just based on that alone, we hypothesized that there would be a positive correlation between renewable energy consumption and the GDP/CO2 emissions coefficient per state. 

Initially, we looked to see how renewable energy consumption stacked up against state GDP in 2015. A lot of the data points were consolidated in one area, however, we can see that there is an overall trend showing an increase in renewable energy consumption following an increase in GDP. And in this small sample, we saw a fairly positive/statistically significant relationship between the two with a r value of 0.7243, and a p value well below 0.05. While based on this graph, one could make the conclusion that higher consumption of reusable energy correlates to a higher GDP per state, the further we dig, the more unclear that correlation becomes. 

Following that we took it a step further to compare the renewable energy consumption to a state's GDP to CO2 emissions coefficient. Here is where we began to see a disconnect between the two and the inability to reject the null hypothesis. An r value from the linear regression model provides us with a correlation coefficient ranged between -1 and +1. From here, the closer you are to - or + 1 provides a reason to believe the two variables have a relationship to one another. In this case, however, we can see that our r value is closer to 0, with an r value of 0.3069. The closer it is to 0, the less likely we can determine a correlation between the two variables. 

With that in mind, we wanted to dig a bit deeper and see if a specific type of renewable energy, for example, solar power, could make an impact on the GDP/CO2 emissions coefficient. We also wanted to see if there would be a comparison with a non-renewable energy source, such as coal.  

However, upon gathering the data for both solar power and coal consumption, we found that both sources of energy did not have a strong correlation with a state's GDP to CO2 emissions, going as far as to show coal with negative linear regression line. 

California was an interesting outlier, as the state consumed the most solar power in 2015 while having the one of the top GDP to CO2 emissions coefficients in the US. However, this is an outlier in comparison to the rest of the state datapoints solar utilization

There are a few factors to take into consideration when it comes to renewable energy. For example, solar power can be found in abundance in California, as seen with it being an outlier on the solar power consumption graph, but in a place such as Alaska, that does not receive the same share of sunlight, solar power would not be a viable option. Utilization of water to create energy through means of a dam or wind energy through a turbine would be nothing if a state didnâ€™t have naturally flowing rivers or adverse weather. 

Based on the data present, we were not able to fully reject the null hypothesis
